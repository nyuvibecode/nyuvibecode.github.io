# Overview

There are a couple different ways you may approach the performance and functionality report.

## Write it yourself
We are not expecting much from the performance and functionality report. For performance, just make sure that we're not stuck on a loading screen waiting forever, that everything works within a reasonable timeframe. For functionality, tell us how everything is supposed to work and what works as it's supposed to and what's not. This will be enough for the report.

## AI Generation
You can ask an LLM (e.g. ChatGPT) to generate a performance and functionality report.

## Tools
These are not required, but for developers who want to gain familiarity or are familiar with these tools. We understand this process can be time consuming and require setup. You are not required to go this far. However, if you're interested, a couple examples of tools include:
- Google Lighthouse
- GTmetrix
- WebPageTest
- Pingdom Website Speed Test
- DebugBear
- SpeedCurve
- Calibre
- k6 Cloud
- Loadmill / BlazeMeter
- Postman Monitor
